# Network Enumeration Checklist

## Initial Discovery
- Identify live hosts in the target network
- Determine network range and segmentation
- Detect firewalls, gateways, and routing behavior

## Port and Service Enumeration
- Identify open TCP and UDP ports
- Enumerate running services and versions
- Detect uncommon or misconfigured services

## Protocol Enumeration
- Enumerate SMB, FTP, SSH, HTTP, DNS, SNMP where applicable
- Identify anonymous or weak access configurations
- Review banner information for potential misconfigurations

## Authentication and Access
- Identify authentication mechanisms in use
- Detect weak or default credentials exposure
- Review access control boundaries between services

## System and Infrastructure Analysis
- Identify operating systems and architectures
- Detect virtualization or containerized environments
- Map trust relationships between systems

## Findings Documentation
- Record discovered services and access points
- Identify potential attack paths
- Prepare enumeration data for exploitation phase
